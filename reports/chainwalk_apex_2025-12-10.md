# The ChainWalk Desk — APEX Daily Deck v2.0
Date: 2025-12-10 · Regime: COMPRESSION · Phase: EARLY
CTI (Chain Tension Index): 5.4/10 — tension stored, not released
Custody Vector: neutral (streak 0) · Entropy: flat
Desk Verdict: volatility is guaranteed; only timing is unknown

Regime Integrity: RELAXED

-------------------------------------
1) REGIME OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------
1) REGIME OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------
Regime: COMPRESSION (streak 5, flips 0)
Outcome: volatility is guaranteed; only timing is unknown
CTI: 5.4/10 — chain tension neutral
Custody Vector: neutral (streak 0)
Entropy Field: flat
Price Corridor: permitted

Incentive Delta: -0.23  (positive = behavior leaning with incentives, negative = fighting them)
Custody Trapdoor: Trapdoor latent — compression is building, but not yet dangerous.

-------------------------------------
2) TEMPORAL WINDOWS
-------------------------------------
desire is decaying — 14 days remain before intent collapses.
EARLY COMPRESSION — 35–65 days left in this coil.

Intent Window: 14 days until intent collapses
Regime Window: 35–65 days remaining

-------------------------------------
3) WAVEFUNCTION READOUT
-------------------------------------
Dominant Vector: COMPRESSION
Expectation Bias: +0.000

Interpretation:
- The wavefunction encodes the chain's preference over regime outcomes.
- A higher expectation magnitude means the chain is leaning harder into one path.

-------------------------------------
4) DRIVER PANEL
-------------------------------------

| DRIVER  | STATE              | DIRECTION | WEIGHT |
|---------|--------------------|----------:|-------:|
| CTI     | 5.4/10           | ↑ | +0.54 |
| Custody | neutral (st 0) | ↑ | +0.29 |
| Intent  | BLEEDING         | ↓ | -0.52 |

Mempool Signal:
- Mempool intent is bleeding — desire is leaving the queue before it can settle to chain.

-------------------------------------
4.5) MINER INCENTIVE FIELD
-------------------------------------
### Miner Incentive Field

- Hashrate trend: **flat**
- Miner stress: **0.0 / 10** · band: **calm**
- Threshold: AMBER — stress rising; miners nearing forced-seller territory (MTI 0.27).
- Interpretation: Miner field calm — producer pressure not yet directional.


-------------------------------------
4.6) DIFFICULTY EPOCH
-------------------------------------
Epoch tension: BALANCED (ETI 0.33) — Epoch balanced — adjustment pressure building but not extreme.

-------------------------------------
4.8) CONSTRAINT STACK
-------------------------------------
CTI — chain tension (how tightly Bitcoin’s incentive coil is compressed)
MTI — miner threshold (how much stress producers can absorb before leaning on price)
IRQ — irreversibility (how much optionality has been eliminated; unwind no longer benign)
REI — resolution field (how close the system is to forcing a regime outcome)

-------------------------------------
4.11) UNCERTAINTY QUOTIENT
-------------------------------------
Uncertainty Field (UQI): ❓ open — futures are being removed (UQI 0.29)

4.9) OUTCOME HUD
-------------------------------------
Samples (last N days): 0
Brier score (coil events): n/a
AUC (pressure score vs events): n/a
Comment: sample size is too small — HUD is in bootstrap mode.

4.10) ORACLE HONESTY
-------------------------
Oracle Honesty: insufficient data — honesty requires history.

-------------------------------------
4.11) SOVEREIGN ORACLE
-------------------------------------
ChainWalk is a measurement-only oracle.
Its inputs are protocol and incentive fields — not price.
Oracle Input Fingerprint: 1da850d5
Price is used only later to grade honesty, not to shape today's view.

-------------------------------------
5) BLOCK OF THE DAY
-------------------------------------
Height: 927086
Miner: UNKNOWN
Custody Action: quiet
Entropy Δ: 0.000
A quiet block inside a tightening coil — nothing escapes, nothing leaks.

-------------------------------------
6) TACTICAL READ
-------------------------------------
Custody remains neutral with a streak of 0, while CTI holds near 5.4.
Incentives are fighting the chain and the trapdoor is latent.
Together, this describes how quickly behavior can snap when the regime resolves.

Volatility is not optional; only path and timing remain negotiable.
