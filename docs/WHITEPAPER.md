# CHAINWALK — SOVEREIGN ORACLE FRAMEWORK

## Abstract
ChainWalk defines a new oracle class for monetary systems:  
**a measurement oracle that excludes the variable it is eventually compared against**.

By refusing price, ChainWalk disentangles cause from reaction and reveals the incentive geometry Bitcoin enforces.

## The ChainWalk Canon

ChainWalk is backed by a set of long-form research documents (the Canon):

- **Technical Whitepaper** — full system definition, constraint stack, UQI, and oracle honesty.  
  👉 [CHAINWALK_TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER.md](./canon/CHAINWALK_TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER.md)

- **Math & Principles** — formal treatment of CTI, MTI, IRQ, REI, UQI, and the constraint geometry.  
  👉 [CHAINWALK_MATH_PRINCIPLES.md](./canon/CHAINWALK_MATH_PRINCIPLES.md)

- **Market Thesis** — why Bitcoin is treated as a physics object, not a market toy.  
  👉 [CHAINWALK_MARKET_THESIS.md](./canon/CHAINWALK_MARKET_THESIS.md)

- **Engineering Roadmap** — how to extend, maintain, and fork the oracle without breaking its sovereignty.  
  👉 [CHAINWALK_ENGINEERING_ROADMAP.md](./canon/CHAINWALK_ENGINEERING_ROADMAP.md)

- **Origin Story** — how ChainWalk emerged from a simple question: “What happens if we measure incentives instead of price?”

## Whitepaper Status
This document evolves with the protocol.

ChainWalk is not finished.

It is unfolding.
