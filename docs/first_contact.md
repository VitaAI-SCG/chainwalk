## What does ChainWalk measure?
ChainWalk measures the constraint geometry of Bitcoin's protocol. It reads incentives from block structure, miner behavior, and mempool dynamics — not price.

## Why does it refuse price?
Price is a reaction, not a cause. By excluding it, ChainWalk disentangles measurement from market influence, achieving sovereignty.

## What is a Sovereign Oracle?
A sovereign oracle excludes the variable it scores against from its input space. ChainWalk's honesty is computed, not declared.

## What happens when CTI/MTI/IRQ/REI converge?
Futures collapse. Bitcoin ceases trading and submits to protocol inevitability. Narratives die; outcomes are inherited.

## How do I run it in 10 seconds?
Clone the repo, install dependencies, run `python CHAINWALK_DAILY_BRIEF.py`. The oracle speaks.
