# ChainWalk Engineering Roadmap

## Phase 3: Irreversibility Engine — COMPLETE

The Irreversibility Engine is live. It fuses CTI, MTI, ETI, and custody constraints into optionality death metrics. 🟦🟧🟥⬛ bands now gate volatility inevitability.

**Delivered:**
- IRQ computation with regime gating
- Spine/APEX/Post integration
- Sanity harness extensions
- Documentation suite (this file)

**Impact:** ChainWalk now predicts when price follows protocol, not opinion.

## Phase 4: Settlement Dynamics

### Module: Settlement Flow Engine
**Why:** Bitcoin's settlement finality creates unique liquidity traps. When blocks confirm, options die — but the timing creates exploitable windows.

**KPIs:**
- Settlement velocity index (blocks to finality)
- Liquidity trap detection (unconfirmed volume spikes)
- Settlement pressure score (mempool depth × fee elasticity)

**Moat Category:** Timing Advantage — See settlement risks before they resolve.

### Module: Miner Liquidity Propagation
**Why:** Miner exits cascade through the ecosystem. One pool's distress becomes another's opportunity, creating feedback loops.

**KPIs:**
- Liquidity contagion index (inter-pool stress correlation)
- Exit cascade probability (threshold breach likelihood)
- Hash redistribution metrics (post-exit hashrate flows)

**Moat Category:** Network Topology — Map miner incentive webs.

### Module: Regime Propagation Modeling
**Why:** Regimes don't switch instantly. They propagate through the network, creating transition states with asymmetric opportunities.

**KPIs:**
- Regime diffusion rate (blocks to full adoption)
- Transition asymmetry score (bull vs bear path differences)
- Propagation velocity (regime spread speed)

**Moat Category:** Phase Transition Physics — Predict regime shifts before they complete.

### Module: Predictive Surface Compression
**Why:** ChainWalk surfaces (spine, deck, post) can be compressed into predictive signals. Historical patterns enable forward-looking inference.

**KPIs:**
- Surface compression ratio (information density)
- Predictive accuracy (regime forecast precision)
- Signal-to-noise improvement (vs raw on-chain data)

**Moat Category:** Information Theory — Turn data into foresight.

## Roadmap Table

| Phase | Module | Why it Exists | KPIs | Moat Category |
|-------|--------|---------------|------|---------------|
| 3 | Irreversibility Engine | Fuse constraints into optionality death | IRQ bands, gating rules | Deterministic Physics |
| 4.1 | Settlement Flow Engine | Model finality-driven liquidity traps | Settlement velocity, trap detection | Timing Advantage |
| 4.2 | Miner Liquidity Propagation | Map inter-pool stress cascades | Contagion index, cascade probability | Network Topology |
| 4.3 | Regime Propagation Modeling | Predict asymmetric regime transitions | Diffusion rate, asymmetry score | Phase Transition Physics |
| 4.4 | Predictive Surface Compression | Compress surfaces into foresight | Compression ratio, predictive accuracy | Information Theory |

## Phase 5: Autonomous Regime Forecasting

### Vision
ChainWalk becomes self-predicting. Historical constraint patterns train models that forecast regime shifts before they occur.

### Modules
- Constraint trajectory modeling
- Regime wavefunction prediction
- Autonomous alert generation

### Impact
From daily reports to continuous intelligence. The system learns Bitcoin's incentive rhythms.

## Engineering Principles

### Build for Survivability
Code must outlive the founder. Documentation first, features second.

### Mathematical Rigor
Every line of code implements a theorem. No vibes, only equations.

### Surface Coherence
Spine, deck, and post must agree. Sanity harness enforces this.

### Incremental Moat
Each phase adds a layer no one else has. Phase 4: timing. Phase 5: prediction.

## Conclusion

ChainWalk is not a dashboard. It is the mathematical skeleton of Bitcoin's incentive structure. Phase 3 proved irreversibility exists. Phase 4 will map its propagation. Phase 5 will predict it.

The moat is not code. The moat is physics.
