# Forkable Vectors

Three sanctioned ways to extend ChainWalk:

## Protocol Forks
Apply the oracle model to Layer 2s, sidechains, or other blockchain protocols. Measure incentives without price input.

## Domain Forks
Apply constraint reading to non-blockchain systems: economies, social networks, AI training data. Identify selective pressures.

## Interpretation Forks
Build dashboards, alerts, visualizations, or art from ChainWalk outputs. Remix the data into new forms.
