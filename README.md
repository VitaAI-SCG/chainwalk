🜂 README.md — CHAINWALK
The Chain Leads Price

Bitcoin doesn’t drift — it releases

What is ChainWalk?

ChainWalk is the first sovereign oracle for Bitcoin — a measurement-based system that reads structural incentives directly from the protocol:

No price input

No sentiment

No TA overlays

ChainWalk measures cause, not reaction.

Where every other dashboard chases price, ChainWalk refuses it — and wins by letting the chain lead.

Why Does It Exist?

Bitcoin is not a market driven by opinion.

It is:

a compression engine

a custody sink

a miner-funded ratchet

a protocol that removes alternatives over time

ChainWalk captures the hidden signals of that system.

What Does It Measure?

ChainWalk tracks the four constraint fields governing Bitcoin’s possible futures:

Field	Meaning
CTI	Chain Tension Index — how tightly Bitcoin’s incentive coil is compressed
MTI	Miner Threshold Index — when miners stop absorbing stress and start leaning on price
IRQ	Irreversibility — how much optionality the system has left before the past dictates the future
REI	Resolution Field — how close the protocol is to forcing a regime outcome
UQI	Uncertainty Quotient — how many futures the system still permits

When these converge, Bitcoin stops trading.

It submits.

Why Sovereign?

A Sovereign Oracle is defined by the variable it excludes.

ChainWalk never takes price as input.

That means:

Markets cannot bribe it

It can be wrong — but cannot be influenced

Calibration is retrospective and honest

This is a new oracle class in monetary epistemology.

Core Outputs

Running ChainWalk produces:

ChainWalk is free and open forever.
If you choose to support it — you are literally funding a new class of oracle.

Status

Phase 6 complete — Constraint Geometry Closed

CTI, MTI, IRQ, REI, and UQI fully implemented

Oracle honesty calibration live

Sovereign oracle definition formalized

[Whitepaper](docs/WHITEPAPER.md) in progress

There is no second best.

This is not TA.

This is incentive geometry.

Price does not lead the chain.
The chain leads price.
